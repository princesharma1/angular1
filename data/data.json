In a way, it is somewhat similar to the Lumia 950 and others, also understandably so given the fact that most of the people who worked with Microsoft Mobile are now part of the HMD.

Same clean colours, the vibrant colours place atop fresh white layers. Nokia says the big OS updates that Google makes for Android will be rolled out to the Nokia 6 and other Nokia smartphones.
